## About Me

Nice to meet you here, what a coincidence! My name is Zhe Liang. I’m currently a master’s student at [Dalian University of Technology](http://www.dlut.edu.cn/) studying Neural Networks and Machine Learning. I’m super passionate about applying technology, productivity and creativity to daily life, and care deeply about shaping myself a better person.

I will be a software developer with a particular interest in web technology. I'm interested in open source technologies and I can't wait to see what is to come of the web in the near future. I’ve been fortunate to be able to do what I love as a career.

Study is natural to me. I spend most of my time shaping up with skills related to technology, productivity and creativity. I’m also fascinated by beautiful design, which I've started to learn.

When not sitting in front of my Mac, I love to hit the gym or go for a swim, which are great ways to hit upon ideas.

## This Site

I started this blog for the purpose of understanding and solidifying the concepts that I learnt, and sometimes I get ideas about things I should write about.

The site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/michaelluang/michaelluang.github.io). It's currently in BETA which means that I'm still developing it. I will be adding new features and functionality to the website over the coming months.

## My Setup

I’m always thinking about how to be more productive with tools and apps that improve daily workflow. Using them smarter, sexier, more elegently and more efficiently is my ultimate goal.

### Hardware

Currently, I'm working on a Mac(Retina Display, 13-inch, Late 2013, 8G RAM, 256 SSD) which expanded by a white Poker II mechanical keyboard. I have an iPhone 6S Plus(Space Gray, 16GB) which has rendered my old but shining iPhone 5(Silver, 16GB) reduntant. When backuping, LaCie Rugged Mini(1 TB) external hard drive comes to help.

### Software

There are many excellent apps available on Mac, which is the main reason I love Apple. Since I started to use Mac, I hava a feeling that my mind is no longer arranged by Microsoft. Instead, I arrange it myself by using these elegent apps!

Below are some essential apps I use daily, for a complete list see [here](/about/app-list/).

For task management, I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to keep life clear. When it comes to personal information management, [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html) helps keep data organized. For writing code, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is my favorite. For writing text, I use [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/), which I love its purity. [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com) is my favorite Git client.

On top of that, there's a bunch of apps I'm using on a daily basis. [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com) is my personal finance app to gain total control of my money. [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) is my password manager. The most important utility I have installed is [LaunchBar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html). My journal app is [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/), and more [here](/about/app-list).
